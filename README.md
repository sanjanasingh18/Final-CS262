# Final-CS262
Final Project for CS262: Distributed Systems
Sophia Ho & Sanjana Singh

Overview: In this project, we build a distributed web crawler to predict outcomes in professional women's tennis with frequency analysis. Our master-slave system was built using GRPC and relies on a response/request protocol and is persistent. Ultimately, we find that the world No. 1, Iga Swiatek, and No. 2, Aryna Sabalenka, ranked players are also the most frequently mentioned players.
